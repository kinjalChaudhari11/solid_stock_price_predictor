# solid_stock_price_predictor
Everyone has to make a stock price predictor at one point this is my attempt slowly working to make it more competative!  

In this project, I developed an LSTM model to predict Apple's stock prices using historical data and technical indicators like the closing price, moving averages, and volume. My goal was to build a model that could provide accurate future stock price predictions. After making many tweaks to my model i was able to get to a solid RMSE of 3.18, which is performing well given that I only used a standard LSTM architecture and basic technical indicators. The final model effectively captured patterns in the data by focusing on recent trends while avoiding overfitting through a simplified two-layer LSTM structure.

The model's performance improved after I reduced the time step to 60 days, allowing it to focus on more recent price movements. I also simplified the LSTM architecture to avoid overfitting and switched to the Adam optimizer, which enhanced training and generalization. While I explored more complex strategies but for now I wanted to stick to the standard LSTM architecture.

Despite the solid performance, thereâ€™s potential for even further improvement. By using more advanced machine learning techniques, such as transformer models, attention mechanisms, or incorporating sentiment analysis from the media, I could potentially lower the RMSE to around 1.5-2.5, bringing the model closer to competing with state-of-the-art systems.
